## Python Program's Function

In this python program, the user's name and age was asked and stored in variables and then it printed out a statement of their name and age.


## Example Code 
```python
age=input("What is your name?")
age=input("How old are you?")
print("Your name is " + name + "and you are " + age + " years old.")
```
## How It Works

To ask for input from the user, the code has to include the word "input" when asking for information from the user while being stored into the variables.
For example in the name variable, the input keyword allows the user's information to be stored into the variable.

When the code is run, the program shoudl prompt the question and after the user replies, it promps the next question and then prints a statement using the user's responses.

## Contribution
We chose this wording of the license because the agreement leaves some ambiguity and flexibility to apply in various contexts yet still keep a strong enough hold to keep the users in check.
