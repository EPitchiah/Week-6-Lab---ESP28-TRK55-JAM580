## Python Program's Function

In this python program, the user's name and age was asked and stored in variables and then it printed out a statement of their name and age.


## Example Code 
```python
name=input("What is your name?")
age=input("How old are you?")
print("Your name is " + name + "and you are " + age + " years old.")
```
## How It Works

To ask for input from the user, the code has to include the word "input" when asking for information from the user while being stored into the variables.
For example in the name variable, the input keyword allows the user's information to be stored into the variable.
The variables can be changed to fit programmer's program.

When the code runs, the program should prompt the question and after the user replies, it promtps the next question and then prints a statement using the user's responses.

## Contribution
The software of this program is licensed into the public domain. It can be used by the authors and by anyone else as long as the copyright laws are maintained. The code of conduct allowed the authors of the program to work together in a peaceful and respectful atmosphere. 

We chose this wording of the license because the agreement leaves some ambiguity and flexibility to apply in various contexts yet still keep a strong enough hold to keep the users in check.
**(add code of conduct explanation of why we use it)**
